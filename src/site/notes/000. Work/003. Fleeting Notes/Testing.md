[Test](000.%20Work/003.%20Fleeting%20Notes/Test.md)

This is just a quick test note to see if all my changes are being pushed everywhere nicely.

And also to see if [[000. Work/003. Fleeting Notes/Obsidian integration|Obsidian integration]] is working well.


And then I'll see references and footnotes later I guess.

With this note I'd also like to see how to connect to other files that are not in the root notes folder. For example:
This note is from the Fiction Folder...

First test... [[Luyanda Michaels|Luyanda Michaels]] and then [[000. Work/003. Fleeting Notes/Obsidian integration|Obsidian integration]]

The second test with [[000. Work/003. Fleeting Notes/Obsidian integration|Obsidian integration]] to see if it's working.


and [[000. Work/003. Fleeting Notes/How to setup this site|How to setup this site]] (this I included just for control)

And then again [[Non-fiction/To-Expound-and-Tag/Incubate/How To Think About Truth|Non-fiction/To-Expound-and-Tag/Incubate/How To Think About Truth]]

and this one is from the non-fiction folder:

Other tests include:

[[000. Work/003. Fleeting Notes/How to setup this site|How to setup this site]] and [[000. Work/003. Fleeting Notes/how markdown is rendered|how markdown is rendered]]
